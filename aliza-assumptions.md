**The basics:**
* 3x3 grid
* 2 players
* Xs and Os show up on screen
* Game detects a win/draw
* Game illustrates win/draw on screen

**My assumptions:**
* We work on functionality first. Style comes later.
* But style will be plain. Maybe have red Xs and blue Os or vice versa.
	* Or maybe the players get to *choose* colors? That would be kind of cool. But we'll figure that out later.
* Text input boxes for players' names. Game doesn't become visible until an acceptable name is submitted.
* White background, black cells (maybe).
* Symbols are placed after a left-click on the cell.
* There's a win/draw message at bottom of screen after game ends.
	* A line of the player's color goes through the 3-in-a-row.
	* The message stands out with a colored background or border.
