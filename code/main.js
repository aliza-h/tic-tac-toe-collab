// Define all the cells for the JS file. Query selectors (getElementById?), event listeners, etc.


// When a cell is clicked, put a symbol in it. We'll worry about the actual symbols later.
// Have a player's name show up when it's their turn.
// Don't allow a cell to be clicked twice.


// When there are three of the same symbol in a row, column, or diagonal, display a win message and end the game.
// "Win" conditions:
	// Group of IDs
	// Row or column

// "Draw" conditions:
	// No cells meet the "win" conditions
// So it's basically a big "if-else" conditional.
