# tic-tac-toe-collab
Working with nolttr21

**Deliverable:** Browser-based tic tac toe game<br/>
**Stakeholders:** Aliza/Tristan/CSET class<br/>
**Constraints:** 5 days to work on it. Needs to be a single webpage.<br/>
**Requirements:**<br/>
* Use both HTML and JS
* 3x3 grid that fits in browser screen
* Alternate filling cells with X or O
	* Randomize starting symbol for first turn
	* Show current player under the grid (name/alias)
* The game should detect a winner or a draw and print the result beneath the grid.
	* A win is 3 consecutive symbols in a row, a column, or either diagonal through the center.
	* A draw is a filled grid without a winner.

**Bonuses:**
* Grid shouldn't be playable after game ends. Have a reset button. Losing symbol goes first.
* Make the game responsive (i.e., let it play on smaller screens)
